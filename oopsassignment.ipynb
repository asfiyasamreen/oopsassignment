    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "ans: classes and objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) that are used to represent real-world concepts and entities. The class represents a group of objects having similar properties and behavior. For example, the animal type Dog is a class while a particular dog named Tommy is an object of the Dog class.\n",

    "Encapsulation: the technique of bundling the data and the methods that operate on the data together in a single unit called an object.\n",
    "Inheritance: the mechanism of reusing the existing code and extending its functionality by creating new classes from existing ones.\n",
    "Polymorphism: the ability of an object to behave differently depending on the context or the type of the object.\n"

    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "ans:Constructors are used to initializing the object’s state. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.\n",

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "ans: the term “self” refers to the instance of the class that is currently being used. It is customary to use “self” as the first parameter in instance methods of a class. Whenever you call a method of an object created from a class, the object is automatically passed as the first argument using the “self” parameter. This enables you to modify the object’s properties and execute tasks unique to that particular instance.\n",

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "ans:Inheritance is defined as the mechanism of inheriting the properties of the base class to the child class. \n",
